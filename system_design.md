5. **Completion and Reporting**:
   - Upon delivery, the Driver confirms completion in the Shipment Tracking module.
   - The Finance/Accounting role generates an invoice through the Order Management module.
   - The Transportation Manager reviews performance data in the Reporting and Analytics module.

## 4. Implementation Considerations

To support these interactions in our Flask and React-based TMS:

1. **API Design**: Create RESTful endpoints for each module, with appropriate permissions for different roles.

   ```python
   @app.route('/api/orders', methods=['POST'])
   @role_required(['Customer', 'CustomerServiceRep'])
   def create_order():
       # Order creation logic
       pass

   @app.route('/api/shipments/<int:shipment_id>/status', methods=['PUT'])
   @role_required(['Driver'])
   def update_shipment_status(shipment_id):
       # Shipment status update logic
       pass
   ```

2. **Frontend Components**: Develop role-specific dashboards and interfaces in React.

   ```jsx
   function DispatcherDashboard() {
     return (
       <div>
         <OrderList />
         <RouteOptimizer />
         <ShipmentTracker />
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

3. **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSocket connections for live updates on shipment tracking and inventory changes.

4. **Data Access Layer**: Use SQLAlchemy to create models with role-based access controls.

   ```python
   class Order(db.Model):
       # ... other fields ...

       @staticmethod
       def visible_to(user):
           if user.role.name in ['Admin', 'TransportationManager']:
               return Order.query
           elif user.role.name == 'Customer':
               return Order.query.filter_by(customer_id=user.id)
           # ... other role-based filters ...
   ```

5. **Integration Points**: Develop clear interfaces for WMS integration in the Inventory Management module.

# Transportation Management System: Integration with Warehouse Management System

## 1. Overview of TMS-WMS Integration

The integration between the Transportation Management System (TMS) and the Warehouse Management System (WMS) is critical for efficient supply chain operations. This integration ensures real-time synchronization of inventory, order, and shipment data between transportation and warehousing processes.

## 2. Key Integration Points

### 2.1 Inventory Management

- Real-time inventory levels
- Stock location within warehouses
- Inventory reservations and allocations

### 2.2 Order Fulfillment

- Order details and status
- Pick and pack information
- Shipment readiness status

### 2.3 Inbound Shipments

- Advanced Shipping Notices (ASN)
- Receiving schedules
- Dock door assignments

### 2.4 Outbound Shipments

- Shipment details and documentation
- Loading schedules
- Carrier information

## 3. Data Flow Between TMS and WMS

### 3.1 TMS to WMS

- New orders for fulfillment
- Inbound shipment notifications
- Carrier and transportation details
- Estimated arrival times

### 3.2 WMS to TMS

- Inventory levels and stock locations
- Order status updates
- Shipment readiness notifications
- Proof of delivery confirmations

## 4. Integration Architecture

We'll use a RESTful API approach for the TMS-WMS integration, with webhook support for real-time updates.

### 4.1 API Endpoints

```python
# TMS API endpoints for WMS
@app.route('/api/wms/orders', methods=['POST'])
def receive_order_from_wms():
    # Logic to receive and process new orders from WMS
    pass

@app.route('/api/wms/inventory', methods=['GET'])
def get_inventory_for_wms():
    # Logic to provide current inventory levels to WMS
    pass

# WMS API endpoints for TMS
@app.route('/api/tms/shipment_status', methods=['PUT'])
def update_shipment_status():
    # Logic to update shipment status in TMS
    pass

@app.route('/api/tms/asn', methods=['POST'])
def receive_asn():
    # Logic to process Advanced Shipping Notices
    pass
```

### 4.2 Webhook Support

```python
@app.route('/api/webhooks/inventory_update', methods=['POST'])
def inventory_update_webhook():
    # Logic to handle real-time inventory updates from WMS
    pass

@app.route('/api/webhooks/order_status_change', methods=['POST'])
def order_status_change_webhook():
    # Logic to handle order status changes from WMS
    pass
```

## 5. Key Processes and Their Implementation

### 5.1 Order Creation and Fulfillment

1. Order received in TMS
2. TMS checks inventory availability with WMS
3. TMS sends order details to WMS for fulfillment
4. WMS updates order status as it's processed
5. WMS notifies TMS when order is ready for shipment

```python
def create_order(order_data):
    # Create order in TMS
    order = Order.create(order_data)

    # Check inventory with WMS
    inventory_status = requests.get(f"{WMS_API_URL}/inventory", params={"items": order.items})

    if inventory_status.is_sufficient():
        # Send order to WMS for fulfillment
        wms_response = requests.post(f"{WMS_API_URL}/orders", json=order.to_dict())

        if wms_response.is_success():
            order.update(status="In Fulfillment")
        else:
            order.update(status="Fulfillment Error")
    else:
        order.update(status="Insufficient Inventory")

    return order
```

### 5.2 Inventory Synchronization

1. WMS sends real-time inventory updates to TMS
2. TMS processes updates and reflects changes in its system
3. TMS uses updated inventory data for order planning and routing decisions

```python
@app.route('/api/webhooks/inventory_update', methods=['POST'])
def inventory_update_webhook():
    inventory_data = request.json

    for item in inventory_data:
        Inventory.update_or_create(
            item_id=item['id'],
            quantity=item['quantity'],
            location=item['location']
        )

    # Trigger any necessary actions based on inventory changes
    check_low_stock_alerts(inventory_data)
    update_order_fulfillment_status(inventory_data)

    return jsonify({"status": "success"}), 200
```

### 5.3 Shipment Coordination

1. TMS creates shipment plan
2. TMS sends shipment details to WMS
3. WMS prepares shipment and updates status
4. WMS notifies TMS when shipment is ready for pickup
5. TMS dispatches carrier for pickup

```python
def create_shipment(order_id):
    order = Order.get(order_id)
    shipment = Shipment.create(order=order)

    # Send shipment details to WMS
    wms_response = requests.post(f"{WMS_API_URL}/shipments", json=shipment.to_dict())

    if wms_response.is_success():
        shipment.update(status="Preparing")

        # Set up webhook to listen for shipment ready notification
        webhook_url = url_for('shipment_ready_webhook', shipment_id=shipment.id, _external=True)
        requests.post(f"{WMS_API_URL}/webhooks", json={"url": webhook_url, "event": "shipment_ready"})
    else:
        shipment.update(status="Preparation Error")

    return shipment

@app.route('/api/webhooks/shipment_ready', methods=['POST'])
def shipment_ready_webhook():
    shipment_data = request.json
    shipment = Shipment.get(shipment_data['id'])

    shipment.update(status="Ready for Pickup")

    # Dispatch carrier for pickup
    dispatch_carrier(shipment)

    return jsonify({"status": "success"}), 200
```

## 6. Error Handling and Resilience

- Implement retry mechanisms for failed API calls
- Use message queues (e.g., Celery with Redis) for asynchronous processing
- Set up monitoring and alerting for integration failures
- Implement data validation and sanitation for all incoming data from WMS

## 7. Security Considerations

- Use OAuth 2.0 for API authentication between TMS and WMS
- Implement rate limiting to prevent API abuse
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Regularly audit and rotate API keys

## 8. Testing the Integration

- Develop comprehensive unit tests for all integration points
- Create integration tests simulating various scenarios (e.g., inventory changes, order status updates)
- Perform regular end-to-end tests of the entire order-to-shipment process
- Set up a staging environment that mimics the production setup for thorough testing

# TMS-WMS Integration: Detailed Workflow and Multi-Company Scenarios

## 1. Database Schema for WMS-related Data in TMS

First, let's look at how we might structure our database to handle WMS-related data:

```sql
-- Warehouses
CREATE TABLE warehouses (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    location VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    company_id INTEGER,
    wms_integration_id VARCHAR(50),
    FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES companies(id)
);

-- Inventory
CREATE TABLE inventory (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INTEGER,
    warehouse_id INTEGER,
    quantity INTEGER,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (warehouse_id) REFERENCES warehouses(id)
);

-- Orders
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INTEGER,
    status VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id)
);

-- Order Items
CREATE TABLE order_items (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INTEGER,
    product_id INTEGER,
    quantity INTEGER,
    warehouse_id INTEGER,
    status VARCHAR(50),
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (warehouse_id) REFERENCES warehouses(id)
);

-- WMS Integration Logs
CREATE TABLE wms_integration_logs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    warehouse_id INTEGER,
    event_type VARCHAR(50),
    payload TEXT,
    status VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (warehouse_id) REFERENCES warehouses(id)
);
```

This schema allows us to track inventory across multiple warehouses, associate orders with specific warehouses, and log integration events with various WMS systems.

## 2. Detailed Workflow

Let's break down the workflow for processing an order:

1. **Order Reception**:

   - Orders can be received from various sources (e-commerce platform, EDI, manual entry).
   - The Customer Service Representative or an automated system checks incoming orders.

2. **Order Validation**:

   - The TMS validates the order (e.g., product availability, customer credit).
   - If valid, the order status is updated to "Validated".

3. **Inventory Check**:

   - The TMS queries the relevant WMS for current inventory levels.
   - If sufficient inventory exists, the order moves to "Ready for Fulfillment".

4. **Warehouse Assignment**:

   - The TMS assigns the order to a specific warehouse based on inventory availability and proximity to the customer.

5. **WMS Notification**:

   - The TMS sends the order details to the assigned warehouse's WMS.

6. **Pick and Pack**:

   - Warehouse staff receive picking instructions through their WMS.
   - Items are picked from their locations and brought to a packing station.
   - Packers prepare the items for shipment.

7. **Shipment Creation**:

   - Once packed, the WMS notifies the TMS that the order is ready for shipment.
   - The TMS creates a shipment record and plans the transportation.

8. **Carrier Assignment**:

   - The TMS assigns a carrier based on shipping requirements and contracts.

9. **Shipment Pickup**:

   - The assigned carrier picks up the shipment from the warehouse.

10. **Tracking and Delivery**:
    - The TMS tracks the shipment and updates stakeholders on its progress.
    - Upon delivery, the TMS records the completion and updates the order status.

## 3. Multi-Company WMS Scenarios

Your question touches on a crucial aspect of supply chain management: the interaction between different companies' systems. Let's consider two scenarios:

### Scenario 1: "Example Tech Company Logistics" (ETCL)

In this case, ETCL is using the TMS to manage its own inventory and fulfill customer orders.

- ETCL has its own WMS managing one or more warehouses.
- The TMS integrates directly with ETCL's WMS.
- When inventory runs low, the TMS can trigger purchase orders to suppliers.

### Scenario 2: "Example Supplier For Tech Companies" (ESFTC)

Here, ESFTC is a supplier to companies like ETCL.

- ESFTC has its own WMS managing its inventory.
- ETCL's TMS doesn't directly integrate with ESFTC's WMS.
- Instead, ETCL's TMS would integrate with ESFTC's order management or ERP system.

### How They Work Together

1. **Inventory Management**:

   - ETCL's TMS regularly syncs inventory levels with its own WMS.
   - When inventory for a product falls below a threshold, the TMS triggers a reorder process.

2. **Ordering from Supplier**:

   - ETCL's TMS creates a purchase order for ESFTC.
   - This order is sent to ESFTC's order management system, not directly to their WMS.

3. **Supplier Processing**:

   - ESFTC receives the order in their system.
   - ESFTC's system communicates with their WMS to fulfill the order.

4. **Shipment from Supplier**:

   - ESFTC's WMS manages the picking, packing, and shipping process.
   - ESFTC's system sends shipping information back to ETCL's TMS.

5. **Receiving at ETCL**:
   - ETCL's TMS creates an inbound shipment record.
   - When the shipment arrives, ETCL's WMS processes the receipt.
   - The received inventory is then reflected in ETCL's WMS and synced back to the TMS.

## 4. Implementation Considerations

To handle these multi-company scenarios, consider the following in your TMS design:

1. **Company Relationships**:

   ```python
   class Company(db.Model):
       id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
       name = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
       type = db.Column(db.String(50))  # 'own', 'supplier', 'customer'

   class CompanyRelationship(db.Model):
       id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
       company_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('company.id'))
       related_company_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('company.id'))
       relationship_type = db.Column(db.String(50))  # 'supplier', 'customer'
   ```

2. **Integration Points**:

   ```python
   class IntegrationPoint(db.Model):
       id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
       company_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('company.id'))
       integration_type = db.Column(db.String(50))  # 'wms', 'erp', 'oms'
       api_endpoint = db.Column(db.String(255))
       auth_method = db.Column(db.String(50))
   ```

3. **Order Processing**:

   ```python
   def process_reorder(product_id, quantity):
       supplier = get_preferred_supplier(product_id)
       integration_point = IntegrationPoint.query.filter_by(
           company_id=supplier.id,
           integration_type='oms'
       ).first()

       if integration_point:
           send_purchase_order(integration_point, product_id, quantity)
       else:
           notify_procurement_team(product_id, quantity, supplier.id)
   ```

This structure allows your TMS to manage relationships with multiple companies (own warehouses, suppliers, customers) and integrate with their systems as appropriate, whether that's a direct WMS integration or communication with an order management system.

```

## 3. Technology Stack

- **Backend Services**: Python with Flask
- **Frontend**: React
- **API Gateway**: Kong or AWS API Gateway
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ
- **Cache**: Redis
- **Databases**:
  - PostgreSQL (Relational)
  - MongoDB (Document Store)
  - InfluxDB (Time Series)
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins or GitLab CI
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana

## 4. Deployment Strategy

We'll use a container-based deployment strategy with Kubernetes for orchestration. This approach offers flexibility, scalability, and ease of management.

### 4.1 Containerization

Each microservice will be containerized using Docker. Here's an example Dockerfile for one of our services:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["gunicorn", "-b", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app:app"]
```

### 4.2 Kubernetes Deployment

We'll use Kubernetes to manage our containerized services. Here's an example Kubernetes deployment YAML for the Order Management Service:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: order-management
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: order-management
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: order-management
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: order-management
          image: our-registry/order-management:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 5000
          env:
            - name: DATABASE_URL
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: db-secrets
                  key: url
            - name: REDIS_URL
              value: "redis-master.default.svc.cluster.local"
```

### 4.3 CI/CD Pipeline

We'll implement a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins or GitLab CI. Here's a simplified example of a CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Code Commit**: Developer pushes code to Git repository
2. **Automated Testing**: Run unit and integration tests
3. **Build Docker Image**: Create a new Docker image with the updated code
4. **Push to Registry**: Push the Docker image to our container registry
5. **Deploy to Staging**: Automatically deploy to staging environment
6. **Manual Approval**: Require manual approval for production deployment
7. **Deploy to Production**: Roll out the new version to production

### 4.4 Blue-Green Deployment

For zero-downtime updates, we'll use a blue-green deployment strategy:

1. Deploy the new version (green) alongside the current version (blue)
2. Gradually shift traffic from blue to green
3. If any issues occur, quickly rollback by shifting traffic back to blue
4. Once green is stable, decommission the blue version

## 5. Scaling Strategy

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Use Kubernetes' Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to automatically scale services based on CPU utilization or custom metrics
- **Database Scaling**: Implement read replicas for PostgreSQL to handle increased read traffic
- **Caching**: Utilize Redis caching to reduce database load for frequently accessed data
- **CDN**: Use a Content Delivery Network for static assets to improve global performance

## 6. Monitoring and Logging

- **Centralized Logging**: Use the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log aggregation and analysis
- **Metrics**: Use Prometheus for collecting and storing metrics, with Grafana for visualization
- **Alerting**: Set up alerting rules in Prometheus Alertmanager to notify on-call personnel of any issues
- **Tracing**: Implement distributed tracing using Jaeger to monitor and troubleshoot microservices

## 7. Security Considerations

- **Network Policies**: Implement Kubernetes Network Policies to control traffic between pods
- **Secrets Management**: Use Kubernetes Secrets or a dedicated secret management system like HashiCorp Vault
- **Authentication**: Implement OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for secure authentication
- **Encryption**: Use TLS for all service-to-service communication
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing
