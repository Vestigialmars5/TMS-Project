# Transportation Management System Project

## A simulated transportation management system (TMS)

## Description
A TMS web app that will simulate how a real life TMS would work.
 
## Main Goal
My main goal is to push myself with this project. I plan on learning a lot of things while developing it. 
It will definitely be a slow process but I'm looking forward to learning how to develop something that is actually used by many companies.
