# Transportation Management System Project

## A simulated transportation management system (TMS)
Welcome to my Transportation Management System project. This project will be a simulated TMS, built using Flask for the backend and React for the frontend.
 
## Main Goal
My main goal is to push myself with this project. I plan on learning a lot of things while developing it.
It will definitely be a slow process but I'm looking forward to learning how to develop something that is actually used by many companies.
My main goal regarding the project is a fully simulated TMS, managing trnasportaion operations, logistics, inventory, shipments, and more.
