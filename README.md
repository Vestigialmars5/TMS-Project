# Transportation Management System Project

## A simulated transportation management system (TMS)

Welcome to my Transportation Management System project. This project will be a simulated TMS, built using Flask for the backend and React for the frontend.

## Main Goal

My main goal with this project is to push myself and learn a lot in the process.
It is a very complicated project, but I wanted to just throw myself at this challenge and let it teach me on the go.
My main goal regarding the project is a fully simulated TMS, that can manage transportation operations, logistics, inventory, shipments, and more.

# Expected Features

- **User Management**: Add, edit, remove users, and assign roles and permissions.
- **Simulation Model**: Create warehouses, manage inventory, and simulate various transportation scenarios.
- **Transportation Management**: Plan routes, manage carriers, track shipments, and optimize costs.
